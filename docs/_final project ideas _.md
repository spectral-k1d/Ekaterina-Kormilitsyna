### **SENTIMENTAL COMPUTATION**

**Alternative Networks Structures:**

Sending data through mycelium networks: 

Speculation is a praxis aimed in equal measure towards the future and past → It is nostalgia for a future never yet to come 

In 2019, Julian Hespenheide, created a speculative research piece under the guise of a ficticious research group:
“Biotic Explorers Research Group -(2019) Narrative Explorations with Eukaryotic Systems”

But fiction can only take you so far. 

Fiction and speculation provide a security blanket of the imaginary, however it also serves to flesh out a world of possibilities.

With this project, ultimately I’m aiming to allow myself to make physical and functional attempts of prototyping little steps towards a possibly functioning prototype, through out the weeks.

Julian’s System used pH at either end of a fungal system - I would like to use electricity. 

I would also like to branch out and use other possible communication methods used by plants. This becomes a project in seeking and prototyping trans-human communication methods, using introducing biological cybernetics: rigging together LED displays and various sensors to use existing plant-based communication networks to display outwardly.

## Other Possible Ideas to Develop

### gLitch Studies;

needs further thoughts… Georg suggested I consider a smaller project that has a more direct weekly outcome: his suggestion was that I consider my interest in sounds and electronic glitches. 
 This way each week I could confront the inevitable failures of projects, to consider how those could translate into visual and noise visualisations- there are multiple possibilities

### seismic visualisations:

still playing with ideas visualisations, but building local sensors of seismic changes… also for within the body.. visualising the biological using the technological… possibilities of doing it via sound also?

Also gives room for the mythological… magical computation… 

Technological mechanisms waiting and trying to measure the ephemeral…
like objects which can only operate when the code which is linked to a online telescope repository allows them too… technology which waits for the stars to align.

### remote visualisations:

A more politically oriented project- linking to telegram groups which post images of war… figuring out possible creative visualisation of the frequency of war-crimes and war-reporting. 

Overall all of my current ideas and projects deal with concepts of developing unusual methods of visualisation of communication. That being said, communication is only yet another form of visualisation, and vice-versa in key it is about transcoding information from one medium to another in a way that is capable to transcend space and time. 

There is something mystical to that. Using technological maker skills to attempt and capture something ephemeral… more over to be able to design it to either in the future operate without further human intervention and seek a post-human future of techno-natural communication possibilities… or to instead seek a reality which allows us to widen our scope of sensibilities beyond that being limited to current modes of communications employed by societal structures: 

[Something to consider in the latter is to not forget to research and include native and aboriginal communication methods not exclusive to the western world- Communication methods and structures have often traversed into the natural. ]




###FEEDBACK FROM FIRST SESSION:

I should come up with a specific product for the final week! Step away from just concepts 

analogue video signal chips! - to use real analogue displays
