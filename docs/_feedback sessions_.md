### _ week 00- 1 _ 


still struggling with final project: maybe look at a local problem that you could solve? 
define target user


myself can also be a target user.. define input and output. 


stress measurer: noise-album 

sensing the enviroment: measure mushroom bio-sensors.. understand and visualize another aspect of kamakura mushrooms.

DATA-COLLECTION DEVICE! you can separate the collection device and the display process! 

so you need to design a data-collection device.. various possibilities of sensing.. can it read human bio-sensors... but also the enviroments biosensors.... and it can output it to noise music... and also visual outputs... alorythic outputs... 

can I interact with the data once it's collected? does it allow for a collaboration with the enviroment? 

What would you like the design to be? kind of old school- anime style device? inspired by apocalyptic games and dragon ball? 

choose 10 words that describes your probject:
mycellium 
sensing
communication
algorythm
