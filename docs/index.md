| Welcome human, robot, plant and weary traveler,   |
  I’m an interdisciplinary researcher and artist     
| working with media, film, technology and socio-   |
  political research. My main research focus         
| lies in network structures; material mythologies, |
  philosophies of aesthetics and ethics of           
| post-humanism and now most recently interspecies  |
  communication and interaction and the ways they    
| relate to the topics above.                       |
