# _final project ideas - 2nd _
### **SENTIMENTAL COMPUTATION**

**Alternative Networks Structures:**

Sending data through mycelium networks: 


The ideas I outlined last week were primarily speculative and conceptual. The goal for this week was to figure out whether they could be adapted this week to become more of an object rather than an idea. 
In an attempt to this I tried to break down my thought process into questions to understand why I was failing to do this.

Was I able to boil my concept down to an object: 
No. 

**Why was not able to do this?** : 
I realised that I was batteling two conflicting concepts: On the one hand I was focused on a maschine that would visualise different forms of sensing and different sensing objectives using aesthetics, on the other I wanted to incooporate mycellium as a material conductive implementation. But in the end there was no definitive of simple idea to drive a product design.

**What problem am I trying to solve?**
The primary focus of the project is both philosophical and artistic.
I want my project to be about sensing beyond the usual human scope.

so on the first level: this is a visualizer that can sense both human and non-human levels.

**So what kind of simple idea could be implemented for now as a product focuced idea?** 
This is something I am still struggling with.
