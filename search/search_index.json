Most of the aesthetic ideas I have I am struggling to implement. I know there is a lot that I still have to figure out in the next couple of days, especially if I want the site to represent some of my ideas and design ideas that relate to the project. Even for today, I struggled a lot with doing simple customisation, and it\u2019s still not working, even when I try to change the font etc. </p> <p>I have also a harder time proofreading using mkdocs work-flows considering my dyslexia.</p> <p>Aesthetically I very much prefer the look of notion pages, however I am absolutely aware of how limiting they are in terms of creating an actual website. So for today I have also put all of this documentation into Notion in an attempt to help myself stay organised.  You can find this site here: NOTION PAGE</p>"}]}
